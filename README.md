## Objective
I was asked to create a weather application that will display the current weather conditions along with a 5-day forecast for a selected city. As the user made searches, their saved cities will appear in a list that they can refer to if needed.

## Approach
I began this week sketching the actual page along with finding suitable Bootstrap elements to match the mockup given. (See below)

After creating the page where the application would live, I began pseudocoding the JavaScript file. Initially, my search function would encase all of the moving parts to display the weather conditions, but after discussing it with my TAs and other students, I opted to break up the function so I could mitigate mistakes and see if everything was working as intended.

I utilized my knowledge from previous weeks along with getting help from TAs and other students to complete my application.

## Final Statements/ Conclusion
I have a newfound respect for coding and the intricacies that lie beneath the surface. Oftentimes, we see a webpage and take for granted that someone had to meticulously ensure that all of the elements worked properly so we can have an enjoyable experience. I know I would get upset and frustrated when links on a page were broken or a button did not complete the function it was designed to, but as a growing developer, I realize that those issues are par for the course. I look forward to digging deeper into the skills I've learned over the past 6 weeks and having the opportunity to work with my fellow classmates on our upcoming projects.
